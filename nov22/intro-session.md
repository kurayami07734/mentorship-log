# Introductory Session 

Things I talked about.

1. Basic intro of everyone who attended.
2. Intro of myself.
3. Basic primer on the internship selection procedure.
    1. Companies will come, right around the start of 5th sem (i.e., July 2022)
    2. You will face an online test (which may include aptitude + english, os + dbms but will surely include coding problems)
    3. After that there maybe a group discussion (not necessary)
    4. Technical Interview
        1. Introductions (of both parties)
        2. Discussion on the projects
        3. DSA problems (medium to medium-hard level)
4. Try to make some project during break after 4th sem.
5. Try to maintain a CPI above 8 to be on safe side.
6. You will not understand any of the topics instantly, do not get depressed just keep at it.

## FAQs

### How to improve consistency?

1. Use **time tracking software** to improve your consistency (aim for 1-2 hrs of coding every day). I use [Toggl](https://track.toggl.com/)
2. Set a time for coding. Also try to have some recreation in your day (30 mins to 1 hour).

### What resource is best for learning/problems ?

- There not one perfect learning resource, use anything that resonates the most with you.
- That maybe a video (on youtube or from a course) or a website (gfg, w3schools, etc.)
- Same goes for problem solving (use whatever you like, leetcode, hackerrank, codechef, etc.)
