# TCP Mentorship Program 2022-23

I will attach any relevant material.
And log any activity I conduct.

1.[Nov 2022](./nov22/README.md)


# Rough Timeline of the program

## 23 Nov - 30 Nov ( Language Basics )

- Variable types etc..
- Time and Space Complexity ( intro )
- Basic Looping , operators , conditionals etc...
- (Errors - Run Time Error, SIGSEGV error,.. )
- STL ( Intro - What is it etc.. )
- Basic Problem Solving ex- If else , pattern printing, switch case (
throughout duration ) - become comfortable with using loops etc
- CP easy problems or Any other platform ( start )

## 1 Dec - 31 Dec ( Basic Programming with intro to containers )

- Functions
- Arrays
- Matrix
- STL - Vector ( linking with array )
- Strings (1 week till here )
- Searching (binary search, sequential search) & Sorting Algorithms (
except quick and merge ) - (1 week )
- Mathematics ( Prime Number, Sieve 0f Eratosthenes , exponentiation
, LCM , GCD, Difference array, Modulo Arithmetic,Bit
Manipulation(operations definitions only ))
- Detailed STL and its functions ( Hashmaps , sets, etc)
- Problem practice ( Throughout , CP / other platform )
- Competitive Programming ( Give contests and try to be regular ) (
Throughout if into cp else practice from any )

## 1 Jan - 30 Jan

- Greedy Algos ( intro and practice )
- Sliding Window , 2 pointer , Hashing , Moore's Voting Algo ,
Kadane’s Algo etc.. ( Basic techniques and algo )
- Pointers, Dynamic allocation, OOPs ( Making Classes ,
Structures ,Constructors etc.. ) - for implementing Linked lists
etc... ( C++ User’s )
- Recursion - 1 ( Tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci ...)
- Time and Space Complexity ( recurrence relation etc.. )
- Linked List ( Traversal,Insertion, Deletion, Floyd Cycle Detection)
- Stack & Queues
- Heap & Priority Queue
- Problem Solving ( Very IMP )

## 1 Feb - 28 Feb

- Recursion - 2 ( Divide & Conquer ) ( merge sort, quick sort,
max-sum-subarray, Time Complexity )
- Trees
- BST
- Recursion more practice ( Prep for DP )
- Problem Solving ( Very IMP )
1 March - 31 March
- Binary Search Questions - 1 ( Implement Upper bound , lower
bound , other questions .... )
- BackTracking ( n queen etc... )
- Dynamic programming ( 2 week )
- More Dp practice ( With Trees ..... 1 week )
- String Searching Algo ( KMP , Rabin Karp etc.. )
- Question practice ( Very very very IMP )

## 1 April - 30 April

- Binary Search Questions - 2 ( Maximum Profit , Aggressive
Cows etc ... )
- Graph
- BFS , DFS and Dijkstra algorithm.
- Cycle Detection
- Question practice
1 May - 30 May
- Topo Sort ( Till here IMP )
- Shortest Path Algos ( Bellmans Ford ) ( optional if time permits
)
- Minimum Spanning Trees & algo ( Krushkal , Prims )
- Trie ( optional if time permits )
- Disjoint set Union

## June-July
- Revise all the topics and algorithms covered.
- Practice must do interview problems on Leetcode ,GFG.
- Revise Linklist,BST,Heap.
- Revise your project mentioned in the resume.

## Algorithms Revision :
- Moore’s Voting Algorithm ( Majority Element)
- Kadane’s Algorithm
- KMP
- Rabin Karp
- Activity Selection Problem
- Binary Search
- Etc ... other
